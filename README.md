## Before the start of the project it is necessary:

* Verify that node.js and npm are installed. For this it is enough to write in the terminal
> node -v

If you see a version, for example, v6.9.2 then everything is ok

> npm -v

If you see a version, for example, 4.3.0 then everything is ok

* Make sure that gulp version 4 is installed, as if it is less, it will not work.

> npm install gulpjs/gulp-cli#4.0 -g
